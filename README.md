**Analyzing Heart Failure Clinical Records**

The goal is to analyze the heart failure records and build a prediction model to determine the death event.

The prediction models built were Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forests, and XGBoost. The metrics of performance for the models are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1.

The prediction models built were Logistic Regression, Decision Treek, Random Forest, and XGBoost. LIME, Shap, and eli5 were used in conjunction with these models.

The dataset contains 299 rows and 13 columns.

The features are age; anaemia; high blood pressure; creatinine phosphokinase (CPK); diabetes; ejection fraction; platelets; sex; serum creatinine; serum sodium; smoking; time; and the target variable, the death event.
